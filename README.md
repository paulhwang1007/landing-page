Project: Landing Page

The main goal of this project is to replicate a given design of a landing page of a sample website using the HTML and CSS skills that I have learned in the Foundations Course of TheOdinProject. 

This is simply a project aimed to practice setting up a website from scratch starting from creating the local files to styling the HTML using CSS. There is no functionality in any of the links or buttons and there is no actual content, it just consists of placeholders of where certain content would go.

This project was very useful in familiarizing myself with the practical use of the HTML and CSS skills that I have learned so far and to understand ways that I can use said skills. From creating the content on the page using divs, buttons, etc, styling that content using CSS, and visualizing each component using the box model and flexbox, I was able to independently go through the process of creating a sample landing page of a website.
